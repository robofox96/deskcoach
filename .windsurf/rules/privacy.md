Privacy Contract (must be respected by any implementation):

No frames or videos saved—ever.

Metrics only (angles, timestamps, states, nudges, responses).

All data stored locally.

One-click Purge Data deletes metrics, events, and settings.

Clear camera indicator; Pause Monitoring toggle.

No third-party SDKs that exfiltrate data.

No network calls unless explicitly added later (none in v1).
